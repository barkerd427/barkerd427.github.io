      <description>Becoming A Plumber: Building Deployment Pipelines - LISA17  from Daniel Barker 
A core part of our IT transformation program is the implementation of deployment pipelines for every application. Attendees will learn how to build abstract pipelines that will allow multiple types of applications to fit the same basic pipeline structure. This has been a big win for injecting change and updating legacy applications.
In large enterprises, there are a lot of moving parts to manage.</description>

      <description>Architecting the Future: Abstractions and Metadata - All Things Open  from Daniel Barker 
This talk will explore these concepts within k8s and Docker as well as work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in my current role around continuous delivery pipelines. Attendees will leave with an appreciation for these two concepts and the tools necessary to begin architecting their systems similarly.
Abstractions and metadata are the future of architecture in systems engineering as they were before in software engineering.</description>

Change initiatives are challenging in any established company, but they are even more challenging to start in highly regulated industries. There are constant concerns around compliance and security. It’s very important to alleviate these concerns early and often. This was one component of my strategy.
It’s also important to build shared experiences with the leadership of your company, but how do you do this as a low-level DevOps Engineer?</description>
